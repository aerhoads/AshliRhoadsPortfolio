# AshliRhoadsPortfolio
Project:  I made a resume/portfolio site

CSS Classes:
.header was used to algn my header center and change it colors
ID #container was used to make sure that all of my paragraphs looked the same for alignment, padding, etc.
.magic-button was used for my JavaScript
I am hoping to add additional CSS before the project is due.

JavaScript
I used the magic-button to hide the "Contact Me" button when clicked, but I want to put a modal in for a contact submission form.  I'm hoping to add that before the project is due.
