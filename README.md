# AshliRhoadsPortfolio
Project:  I made a resume/portfolio site.  There are no special requirements needed to run this project, to the best of my knowledge.

CSS Classes:
My CSS classes are commented out to remind my and show you my intentions of where CSS is supposed to act in my page.  I feel like some of my CSS is redundant, so I tried to make IDs instead of classes to cut back on that, but I feel like it's still a little clunky (primarly in the text in the About Me & Resume paragraphs).  Here are the sections that I have commented in my CSS.  I put them in groups by what they did on my page. 

/*Headers & Headings for Main Content*/ 
/*Headshot*/ - this CSS is used to edit my headshot at the top of my page.
/*Main Body Content*/ - used to edit my section containers and body paragraphs.
/*Carousel to center*/ - used to center my carousel in the middle of my page.
/*Modal CSS*/ - used to edit all things concerning my modal
/*Media Query for Modal*/ 




JavaScript
After talking with two mentors, I decided to do my JavaScript portion of this project with a contact form modal.  I used querySelector to select classes in my HTML for my modal.  The modal opens and closes with a click event listener.  If you click inside the modal, you cannot type anything because the modal closes.  I was unable to get this worked out before the project deadline.
