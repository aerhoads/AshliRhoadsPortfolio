# AshliRhoadsPortfolio
Project:  I made a resume/portfolio site

CSS Classes:
.header is used to algn my header center and change it colors
.photo is used to edit my headshot 
#container was used to make sure that all of my paragraphs looked the same for alignment, padding, etc.
#paragraphs was used to edit the text in my containers


.magic-button was used for my JavaScript
I am hoping to add additional CSS before the project is due.

JavaScript
I used the magic-button to hide the "Contact Me" button when clicked, but I want to put a modal in for a contact submission form.  I'm hoping to add that before the project is due.
