        <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-paragraph">We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

            Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Brown is such a nice color. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
            
            Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Let's do that again. See there, told you that would be easy. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.
            
            Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You can do anything your heart can imagine.
